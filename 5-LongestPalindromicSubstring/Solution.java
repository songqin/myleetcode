Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. 
You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters 
which reads the same backward or forward, such as madam or kayak.

Example:
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Example:
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
